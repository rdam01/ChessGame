# ChessGame
A C# console chess game

Chess is a hobby of mine; this project is an exercise for applying my C# knowledge.

Created for .NET 6.0 (Console). 

This is a work in progress. To be done:
- 3-fold repetition detection
- 50-move rule
- improve notation

Playing the game:
- The game is played on one machine. Players take turns by sharing a keyboard.
- Use the arrow keys + ENTER for selecting a piece and destination square.
- The game cancels attempts for invalid moves (the cursor moves back to the starting position).
- The game indicates which player is to move.
- The game gives a message to the player that is in check.
- The game ends when one of the players is checkmated. (Draw/remise situations are t.b.d.)
